# Connecting-and-Programming-a-Circuit-with-6-Servo-Motors-Using-TinkerCad
This project demonstrates connecting and programming a circuit with 6 servo motors using TinkerCad. It covers setting up the circuit, connecting the servo motors, and writing the code to control their movements.

## Step 1: Set Up TinkerCad

- Create a TinkerCad account at [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
- Start a new project

## Step 2: Circuit Diagram

Before connecting all six servo motors in TinkerCad, refer to this diagram for a single servo motor setup:

This diagram illustrates how to connect a servo motor to an Arduino, specifying power (VCC), ground (GND), and signal (PWM) connections.
